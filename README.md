## The project

This is the cocktails database, which use [TheCocktailDB.com API](https://thecocktaildb.com/api.php) for data.

You can search for particular cocktail or just a couple of symbols, then filter by category or ingredient and sort by name, category or main ingredient. For moving through input/button/selects and cards you can use `Tab` and `Shift`+`Tab`, for opening extended card and searching from input line — `Enter`, for closing opened card — `Esc`.

Project use the "Open Sans" font. External packages are Bootstrap and React Polyfill (for IE11 support).

# React assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and ejected to have full control over its configuration.

To complete the assignment, fork this repo and send us a PR. To help us assess the assignment, please commit often and use clear and concise commit messages.

## The assignment

Create an application that:

- retrieves data from an API (refer to https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis/ for public APIs)
- shows a grid of items (thumbnails, cards, etc.)
- has a form that allows filtering the data set
- shows item details (large image or other information available from the API's response) in a modal when an item is clicked

## Requirements

- Test coverage is sufficient
- Linter and tests pass
- Works in IE11 and up
- Eslint rules extend [eslint-config-endouble](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@endouble.com/eslint-config-endouble)
- Uses web fonts (eg. Google Fonts)
- Runs on HTTPS
- Third-party package usage kept to a minimum
- No state managers (MobX, Redux, ...)
- UI is accessible by keyboard
- Code is documented
- Items in the grid show up to four items per row and gracefully degrade to a vertical list on narrow screens
